# In mathematics, a harshad number (or Niven number) in a given number base is an integer that is divisible 
# by the sum of its digits when written in that base. Harshad numbers in base n are also known as n-harshad (or n-Niven) numbers. 
# E.g. 2022 is a HARSHAD numberâ€”meaning it is equally divisible by the sum of its digits, 6.
